                I don't know where to start , i know i am an idiot aboslute idiot! you know i should have trusted you without any doubt and i did troubled you without understanding that you have some work to do i forgot that i am on my vacation not everyone! when you first messaged i thought i'd be rude then we talked and it seemed very good, and then you know ig i was too casual with you which i tried to correct and i hope i did too! i should have trusted you and not used my brain too much. IDK what is it but i still feel that we can be good friends without a doubt i don't want anything more than that just friendship honestly, i can't even say trust me becaz i have broken it so many times know i am really really sorry from bottom of my heart!
